# svenwltr/projects

An overview if my projects and repositories. Also a poor mans project management.

## Active Projects

These projects are working at the moment and I try to keep this projects up-to-date. The amount of work I put into these projects depends on the popularity and my own demands.

## Private Projects

These projects are only for personal use. They are highly personalized and probably aren't usable for anybody else. Still, I share them, because one may be interessted in the source code.

## Examples

Contains examples and skeletons. They don't contain any useful feature, but are either a good starting point for a new project or good examples for explaining something. These are usually one-shot projects, meaning they where created once and never touched again.

## Unmaintained

These project worked at some point, but got abandoned by me, because of missing popularity and I don't use them anymore by myself.
